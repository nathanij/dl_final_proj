Repo for Team {Team Name}'s Final Deep Learning Project

/models/archs/ holds the architectures for the direct trained models.
/unet/ and /resnet/ hold the training framework for said models.
/utils/ holds the functions used in creating the direct training dataset, accessing it, testing the models, and visualizing their results.

Takshsheel and I worked on two different repos so that explains the relative lack of commit history on his part, I just moved all of his files into the repo ({name files here}) pre-submission.

This repo was originally forked from the CCNet repo when I was still trying to get that to work. I was unable to, and as such, no files are shared between the original repo and this fork.
