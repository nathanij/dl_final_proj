Repo for Team {Team Name}'s Final Deep Learning Project

/models/archs/ holds the architectures for the direct trained models.
/unet/ and /resnet/ hold the training framework for said models.
/utils/ holds the functions used in creating the direct training dataset, accessing it, testing the models, and visualizing their results.

Takshsheel and I worked on two different repos so that explains the relative lack of commit history on his part, so I (Takshsheel) uploaded them seperately later.

This repo was originally forked from the CCNet repo when I was still trying to get that to work. I was unable to, and as such, no files are shared between the original repo and this fork.

The foggy cityscapes dataset is credited to Christos Sakaridis. Stemming from this paper https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~csakarid/Model_adaptation_SFSU_dense/.
